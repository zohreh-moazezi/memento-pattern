// Memento Pattern

// providing temporary state of an object
// and restoration of that object from a conversion into a different format...

// often used into serialization and deserialization of data
// JSON <=> JS Object

// You could view a database as an implementation of the Memento design pattern
//     in which objects are persisted and restored. However, the most common reason
//     for using this pattern is to capture a snapshot of an objectâ€™s state so that
//     any subsequent changes can be undone easily if necessary.

// we don't need it now...
